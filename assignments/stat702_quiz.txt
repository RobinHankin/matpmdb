Q1

You are working as a quality engineer and you expect to receive a lot
of 25,000 units of a product that is key in the production system of
the company. The management office instructs you to consider the
following specifications: an acceptable quality level of 0.005; a
probability of rejecting a good lot of 0.05; a rejectable quality
level of 0.07; and a probability of accepting a bad lot of 0.05.

(a) Why would you use a sampling plan? [10 marks]

(b) One of your colleagues suggests the following plan: "take a random
sample of 33 units and reject the lot if there are at least two
defective units".  The management office asks you to analyse this new
plan. What would you conclude and advise? [30 marks]


Q2

A statistics lecturer decides whether or not to take his umbrella to
work.  It might be: rainy or snowy or fine with probabilities 10%, 5%,
0.85% respectively.  His loss function is:

no umbrella--- rain: 8;  snow:  9; fine: 0
umbrella-----  rain: 0;  snow:  0; fine: 1

Analyse this situation in terms of expected loss.  Should he take the
umbrella?


Q3

As per lectures, create an R package using Rstudio.  The package need
only contain a single function, but this must not be the hello
function created by RStudio.  A simple numerical function is fine, for
example:

f <- function(x){x^2+1}

and something of equivalent complexity is fine.  Ensure that your
package passes the checks, and also ensure that your function is
documented adequately.  You will have to ensure that the DESCRIPTION
file etc are correctly edited with correct information.

Create a file using the "build source package" on Rstudio's "build"
tab.  Submit the .tar.gz file to Canvas.
