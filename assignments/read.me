These are the assignments.  NOTE: to process these files and create a
PDF, you will have to copy them to separate directory; I use
"~/fuckwit/".  This is because the manual files in the repo interfere
somehow with the assignments.  Also, you will need to make a directory
"~/fuckwit/figs/" because rstudio will not create such a directory.
