 \newpage


This is the handbook for STAT601.  Details of the course structure, including assessment and timetables, may be found on AUTonline.

```robin.hankin@aut.ac.nz``` 

The whole course is based around R and RStudio which may be downloaded from 

```https://cran.r-project.org/```

and

```https://www.rstudio.com/```

respectively.

This course lectures have been recorded and are available on YouTube at:

```https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL018X5Hlr4RkgE65Pg93TFY-32KCVpW84```

which you may view at your leisure.  Note that the course as delivered will vary slightly from the YouTube videos and in particular the material might be presented in a different order.

The videos are available in a slightly different format on Mediasite.  To view, log in to AUTonline and  then

```content system -> institution -> learn -> maths```

takes you to a number of mathematical resources, including the videos which are at ```STAT601```.
