# Overview {-}

This is the handbook for MATPMDB (statistics).  Details of the course
structure, including assessment and timetables, may be found on
Canvas.  The whole course is based around R and RStudio which may be
downloaded from

[https://cran.r-project.org/]

and

[https://www.rstudio.com/]

respectively.

This course lectures have been recorded and the entire playlist is
available on YouTube at:

```{block2, type='youtube'}
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL018X5Hlr4RkgE65Pg93TFY-32KCVpW84>
```

which you may view at your leisure.  The URL should be clickable in
this and similar boxes throughought the manual.  Note that the course
as delivered will vary slightly from the YouTube videos and in
particular the material might be presented in a different order.  Some
of the links take you to a video which starts midway through a
lecture; if this is a problem, look at the playlist at the link above
and this will show all lectures in order.  Note, however, that each
class is a reasonably self-contained unit, split into three or four
parts.  This manual is distributed under the GNU GPL and is available
