\section{The Poisson distribution}

You will recall from lectures that the Poission distribution has
probability mass function

$$\prob(X=n)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^n}{n!}$$

for some $\lambda>0$.  Here we will try to estimate $\lambda$ based on
observations.

* Calculate the likelihood function for an observation of $n$:

$$\mathcal{L}(\lambda)=C\prob{X=n}=C\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^n}{n!}$$

and we can take $C=n!$ so $\mathcal{L}=e^{-\lambda}\lambda^n$.

* Take observations of $n=1,2,3,4$ and plot likelihood functions and
support functions (that is, the log of the likelihood function) for
these observations.

```{r,include=TRUE}
l <- seq(from=0,to=10,len=100)
plot(l,dpois(1,l),type="l",col='red')
points(l,dpois(2,l),type="l",col='orange')
points(l,dpois(3,l),type="l",col='green')
points(l,dpois(4,l),type="l",col='blue')
legend("topright",lty=1,col=c("red","orange","green","blue"),legend=1:4)
```

* Excellence question: consider $n=0$ from a statistical and
common-sense perspective.  Construct a (one-sided) 95\% confidence
interval for $\lambda$.


# Bayesian analysis 1

Suppose we are investigating parasites on frogs in the Amazon.  We
have a frog but are uncertain if it is of species A or species B.
Frogs have surface parasites; we can count them on the frog and
observe $n=6$ parasites.  The number of parasites is Poisson with
$\lambda=5.5$ for species A and $\lambda=2.2$ for species B.

Consider two hypotheses $H_A$ and $H_B$ with prior probabilities
$p_(H_A)=0.6$ and $p(H_B)=0.4$.  Calculate the posterior
probabilities.




```{r,include=TRUE}
pA <- 0.6  #prior A
pB <- 0.4  #prior B
lA <- dpois(6,5.5)   # likelihood (A)   
lB <- dpois(6,2.2)   # likelihood (B)

posteriorA <- (pA*lA)/(pA*lA + pB*lB)  # observe how C cancels
posteriorB <- (pB*lB)/(pA*lA + pB*lB)
c(posteriorA,posteriorB)
```

# Bayesian analysis 2

A student visits Auckland CBD and enters a randomly chosen
club.  Our student tries to make inferences about this club from the
gender balance of the patrons.  In this particular part of town, the
prior PDF for gender balance is represented by a beta distribution
with $\alpha=\beta=0.5$.

* Our student observes two male patrons in the club.  What is is posterior PDF for gender balance?

```{r,include=TRUE}
p <- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01)
plot(p,dbeta(p,0.5,0.5),main="prior")
plot(p,dbeta(p,0.5+2,0.5),main="posterior")
```

* We define a _gay_ club to be one in which the probability of a patron
being male exceeds 0.9.  What is the probability that our student has
visited such a club?

```{r,include=TRUE}
pbeta(0.9,2.5,0.5,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

* Now suppose he visits another club and observes 2 males and 2 females
in the club.  What is his posterior for this club?  What is the
probability that this too is a gay club?


```{r,include=TRUE}
p <- seq(from=0.01,to=0.99,by=0.01)
plot(p,dbeta(p,2.5,2.5),main="posterior")
pbeta(0.9,2.5,2.5,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

* (excellence question).  The following day our student conducts a
  literature review and discovers that both the clubs he visited were
  indeed gay clubs.  Using this observation, perform a Bayesian analysis for the probability
  that our student is in fact gay.  Use sensible priors and
  likelihoods.

```{r,include=TRUE}
pG <- 0.1  # prior 
pH <- 0.9  # prior B
lG <- 0.1
lH <- 0.0001

posteriorG <- (pG*lG)/(pG*lG + pH*lH)  
posteriorH <- (pH*lH)/(pG*lG + pH*lH)
c(gay=posteriorG,straight=posteriorH)
```
