It is a very frequent occurence in science that we are investigating
an effect and seek evidence that it has occurred.  The general terms
discussed in this chapter are

- hypothesis testing
- standard error of the mean
- null hypothesis
- p-value
- critical region
- confidence interval

We will use a standard dataset drawn from the ```iris``` to illustrate
the general theory.  First we will take our data, drawn from a classic
dataset describing sepal lengths of iris flowers:


```{r}
d <- iris3[,1,"Virginica"]
d
hist(d,col='gray')
```

## Standard error of the mean

```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error>
```

What we want to do is to calculate the *population* mean for sepal
lengths.  That is, we assume that sepal lengths are a random variable
drawn from $N(\mu,\sigma)$ [Gaussian distribution] but with unknown
mean $\mu$.  Of course we can calculate the *sample* mean of our data:

```{r}
mean(d)
```

But what is the *uncertainty* of this estimate?  Observe that the true
population mean of sepal lengths may well be 6.589 or 5.787; but we
would be uncomfortable stating that the true population mean is as
114.2 or -232.  Observe carefully that we are using the *sample mean*
to estimate the *population mean*.

### Sampling distribution of the mean


```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_distribution>
```

It is a mathematical fact that if $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ are independent
and drawn from $N(\mu,\sigma)$, then 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:SEM)
\overline{x}\sim N\left(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is the sample mean.
The standard deviation of the sample mean is known as the *standard
error of the mean*.  We can test that equation \@ref(eq:SEM) is
correct by numerical sampling; we use a standard Gaussian $N(0,1)$ on
the grounds that we know the true value of the mean and standard
deviation.  Supposing we have a sample of size 40:

```{r}
mean(rnorm(40))
mean(rnorm(40))
mean(rnorm(40))
```

the above shows some of the variability of the sample mean.  Because
each of the observations is $N(0,1)$, equation \@ref(eq:SEM) shows
that the sample mean is distributed as
$N\left(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{40}}\right)$.  We can verify this using
```replicate()```:

```{r}
width <- 0.05
n <- 100000
sample_means <- replicate(n,mean(rnorm(40)))
hist(sample_means,breaks=seq(from=-1,to=1,by=width),col='pink')
x <- seq(from=-1,to=1,len=100)
points(x,n*width*dnorm(x,sd=1/sqrt(40)),type="l",lwd=6)
legend("topleft",lwd=c(6,12),col=c("black","pink"),legend=c("theory","numerical"))
```

In the above, the black line shows the distribution function for the
theoretical Gaussian, closely matching the observations.


## Null Hypothesis


```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis>
```

Returning to the sepal lengths, suppose we know that last year the
population mean was exactly 6.4.  Is there evidence that this year the
sepals are longer?

Well, the sample mean certainly exceeds 6.4:

```{r}
mean(d)
```

But as we saw above, there is sampling uncertainty on the mean (the
standard deviation of the sample mean is the standard error of the
mean), so it is not clear whether the sample mean is actually evidence
of a real change, or the result of random variability.

To proceed, we define a *null hypothesis* $H_0$, which is the
statement that there is no change.  The concept of null hypothesis is
difficult and not altogether consistent so I will not define it
formally here.  It usually means something along the lines of "the
effect we are investigating is not present".  The idea is that we give
the null hypothesis a fair go and if it does not account for our
observations we infer that the null is incorrect and that the effect
is real.  We then consider what the null predicts.

If the null is true, we have a standard error of
$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$:


```{r}
x <- seq(from=6.1,to=6.8,len=100)
n <- length(d)
SEM <- sd(d)/sqrt(n)
plot(x,dnorm(x,mean=6.4,sd=SEM),xlab="sample mean",type="l",lwd=4)
legend("topleft",lwd=c(4),col=c("black"),legend=c("null hypothesis"))
abline(v=mean(d),lwd=5,col='red')
text(mean(d),2,"observed sample mean")
```


## p-value

```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value>
```

```{block2, type='youtube'}
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q6KG_ZurcU&index=8&list=PL018X5Hlr4RkgE65Pg93TFY-32KCVpW84>
```


We can assess whether an observation is consistent with a particular
null by calculating the p-value.  We measure consistency by
calculating the p-value:


The p-value is defined as the probability, if the null is true, of
obtaining the observation or an observation more extreme.  Here, "more
extreme" means "larger than the observed sample mean", although other
interpretations are possible and considered later.


```{r}
x <- seq(from=6.1,to=6.8,len=100)
n <- length(d)
SEM <- sd(d)/sqrt(n)
plot(x,dnorm(x,mean=6.4,sd=SEM),xlab="sample mean",type="l",lwd=4)
legend("topleft",lwd=c(4,14),col=c("black","gray"),legend=c("null hypothesis","pvalue"))
text(mean(d),2,"observed sample mean")
jj <- seq(from=mean(d),to=6.8,len=100)
jj1 <- c(jj,rev(jj))
polygon(jj1,c(jj*0,dnorm(rev(jj),mean=6.4,sd=SEM)),col='gray')
abline(v=mean(d),lwd=5,col='red')
```

It is easy to calculate the pvalue in R:


```{r}
1-pnorm(mean(d),6.4,SEM)
```

We compare the pvalue with 0.05 (that is, 5\%), and if it is smaller
than 0.05 we *reject* the null and infer that the null is incorrect.
If, on the other hand, $p$ is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the
null, and come to no conclusion.

In this case the p-value is about 1.8\%, which is less than 0.05 so we
reject the null and conclude that this year the sepals are in fact
longer.

##  Student t-test


```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test>
```

In the above, we have used the estimated value of the standard
deviation given by R idiom `sd()`.  However, the estimated value
is uncertain, as we can see by numerical sampling, here with sample
size 100:


```{r}
replicate(6,sd(rnorm(100)))
```

and if the number of observations is smaller, say 4, then the uncertainty is higher:

```{r}
replicate(6,sd(rnorm(4)))
```

This does not cause a problem if the number of observations is greater
than about 30 but for small sample sizes the error becomes serious.
It is possible to correct the error using a technique called the
*Student t test*.

The concepts are the same but the sampling distribution changes to
reflect the fact that we are conditioning on an estimated value of the
variance.  In any event, the R idiom is straightforward:


```{r}
t.test(d,mu=5.6,alternative="greater")
```

Giving a similar p-value to the Z test above.

## One-sided and two-sided tests

```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-_and_two-tailed_tests>
```		

Recall the definition of p-value: "the probability, if the null is
true, of obtaining the observation or an observation *more extreme*".
Here, we will investigate what "more extreme" means.

Up to now, "more extreme" has meant "larger" but it could easily mean
"further away from the null mean" and we would get an image like the
following:

```{r}
x <- seq(from=6.1,to=6.8,len=100)
n <- length(d)
SEM <- sd(d)/sqrt(n)
plot(x,dnorm(x,mean=6.4,sd=SEM),xlab="sample mean",type="l",lwd=4)
legend("topleft",lwd=c(4,14),col=c("black","gray"),legend=c("null hypothesis","pvalue"))
text(mean(d),2,"observed sample mean")
f <- function(x){
  jj <- c(x,rev(x))
  polygon(jj,c(x*0,dnorm(rev(x),mean=6.4,sd=SEM)),col='gray')
}
y <- seq(from=mean(d),to=6.8,len=100)
f(y)
f(6.4+(6.4-y))
abline(v=mean(d),lwd=5,col='red')
```

In this case the p-value will be double the one-sided value:

```{r}
2*(1-pnorm(mean(d),6.4,SEM))
```

In general one uses a one-sided (right tail) test when we are testing
for the population mean *exceeding* the null mean, a one sided (left
tail) test when we are testing for the population mean being *less
than* the the null mean; and a two-sided test when we are testing for
the population mean *differing* from the null mean.

The decision to use a one-sided or two-sided test is often subtle.  In
this course, there will always be a linguistic clue such as "it is not
clear whether we expect an increase or a decrease" (indicating a
two-sided test), or "the experiment is designed to detect an increase
in mean" or some similar wording.  See previous exam papers for
examples.


## Two-sample hypothesis testing

Although the one-sample test considered above is the simplest case, it
is more common to consider two samples and ask whether they have a
different mean.

If $x_1,\ldots,x_n\sim N(\mu_x,\sigma_x^2)$ and $y_1,\ldots,y_m\sim
N(\mu_y,\sigma_y^2)$ then a sensible null hypothesis might be
$\mu_x=\mu_y$.  Note that the actual values of $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ are
not interesting; we are interested in whether they differ.  Also
observe that we are not interested in the values of the standard
deviations $\sigma_x,\sigma_y$.  Again, one-sided or two-sided tests
may be used.

The details are rather messy but the Student t-test described above
may be modified to cope.  Observe that we are comparing two population
means, neither of which is known with certainty.  They have different
uncertainties which makes life difficut.

The t-test uses $\delta=\overline{x}-\overline{y}$ to test the null.
If the null is true, then $\delta$ has a particular distribution (it
is again a modified student t distribution).  The details are
complicated but R makes life easy.

### Example of two-sample hypothesis testing.

Suppose we collect weights kiwi birds from two forests, forest A and
forest B, and want to know whether the kiwi from A and B differ.
The data is

```{r}
kiwi_a <- c(0.9, 1.02, 1.07, 0.92, 0.84, 0.9, 1.06, 1.01, 1.14, 0.96)
kiwi_b <- c(1.09, 1.14, 1.15, 1.03, 1.18, 1.04, 1.18, 1.17, 1.08, 1.02, 
0.99, 1.06, 1.03)
```

We can calculate the *sample* means easily:

```{r}
mean(kiwi_a)
mean(kiwi_b)
```

But to assess whether this is evidence for the *population* means differing we need a t-test:

```{r}
t.test(kiwi_a,kiwi_b)
```

and we can see from the small p-value (0.007558) that we may reject
the null hypothesis, and infer that the kiwi weights do in fact differ
between the forests.

### Paired test

Sometimes we have a slightly different structure in a dataset, in
which the elements of the two datasets may be paired.  This often
occurs when the two datasets represent the same object but before and
after some treatment or the passage of time.  For example, suppose we
collect exam scores for students before and after some instruction,
and want to investigate whether the instruction was effective.  The
data is:

```{r}
before <- c(smith=112, jones=199, robinson=120, taylor=89, williams=100, brown=110)
after  <- c(smith=119, jones=201, robinson=137, taylor=91, williams=104, brown=109)
before
after
```

Observe how the different students have very different score, but each
one changes a small amount.  Because the datasets have a natural
pairing with each other (we would compare smith _before_ with smith
_after_).

There are two natural approaches.  The simplest is to consider the
difference in scores and perform a t-test on that:

```{r}
t.test(before-after,alternative="less")
```

(also, observe that we use a one-sided test: noone expects the
instruction to *decrease* exam scores).  But this approach effectively
assumes that the variance is unaltered by the instruction, which might
be incorrect (why?).  We can adjust for this by using the *paired*
t-test:

```{r}
t.test(before, after, paired=TRUE,alternative="less")
```

## Binomial distribution and testing

The definition of p-value: "the probability, if the null is true, of
obtaining the observation or an observation more extreme" applies to a
wide variety of null hypotheses and distributions.  Consider, for
example, bernoulli trials of a coin landing heads or tails.  We
suspect that the coin is biased towards heads, that is, the
probability of success $p > \frac{1}{2}$.  Our data is 58 heads out of
100 trials.

To proceed, we specify a null hypothesis $H_0\colon p=\frac{1}{2}$ and
try to obtain a p-value.  The p-value is directly computable in R:

```{r}
sum(dbinom(58:100,100,1/2))
```

See how the above is a *direct* implementation of the definition of
p-value.  In this case, the p-value is 6.6\% so we fail to reject the
null.  Visually:

```{r}
x <- 0:100
plot(x,dbinom(x,100,1/2),col=c(rep("black",59),rep("pink",42)),type="h",lwd=2,main="null distribution; observation=58")
legend("topleft",lty=1,lwd=2,col=c("pink","black"),
        legend=c("more extreme","distribution"))
```

In the above, the red shows the probability, if the null is true, of
obtaining the observation (58 in this case), or an observation more
extreme ($>58$).  This is precisely the definition of p-value.
Incidentally, the professional would use `pbinom()`:

```{r}
pbinom(57,100,1/2,lower.tail=FALSE)
```

### Two-sided binomial tests

The above reasoning applies to two-sided tests.  Suppose we have a
null of $p=1/2$ but are not sure whether the true value of $p$ is
greater than, or less than, 1/2.  Then a two-sided test would be
appropriate because "more extreme" could be interpreted as "further
away from half"

Suppose we observed 69 heads.  Then "more extreme" would mean either
$>69$ heads or $<31$ heads, these values being equally distant from
50.

The p-value would then be 

```{r}
sum(dbinom(c(0:31,69:100),100,1/2))
```

and the p-value is less than 5\% so we reject the null.  Observe that
in this case the two-sided p-value is exactly twice the one-sided
p-value.


## Critical region

There is another view of statistical hypothesis testing, associated
with statistician Karl Pearson.  In his view we consider the null
distribution of our test statistic and regard the tail region of this
as a "rejection region".  The main difference between this approach
and the p-value approach is that we decide *in advance* on a p-value,
then report a yes/no finding: did we reject the null, or not?  In
practice the two approaches are used interchangeably although to be
absolutely consistent one should use one or the other and not mix the
notations (but everyone does).



## Confidence interval

```{block2, type='wikipedia'}
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval>
```


The concept of *confidence interval* is a common one in statistics.
The formal definition is quite hard, and the interpretation difficult.

("Interval" is another word for "range"; .  The basic idea is that we
estimate a *range* of values within which our parameter lies.  We
arrange things so that the probability of this range including the
true value of the parameter is 95\% (other values such as 99\% or
99.5\% are sometimes used, but we will stick to 95\% here).

To fix ideas, consider the following dataset, representing weights of
kiwi birds:


```{r}
kiwi <- c(0.95, 0.56, 0.86, 0.83, 0.88, 0.77, 1.09)
mean(kiwi)
```

Thus the mean value of the kiwi weights is about 0.85kg.  We might
hypothesise that the population mean $\mu$ is 0.9kg, and test this
hypothesis using `t.test()`:

```{r}
t.test(kiwi,mu=0.9)$p.value
```

where the p-value has been extracted (from the full output calculated
by `t.test()`) using a dollar construction.  We can see that we
fail to reject the null that $\mu=0.9$, on the grounds that the
p-value exceeds 0.05.  This says that the population mean being 0.9 is
somehow consistent with our data.  We can now test the hypothesis that
$\mu=1.2$:

```{r}
t.test(kiwi,mu=1.2)$p.value
```

and in this case we may reject the hypothesis that $\mu=1.2$.  It is
clear that we reject values for the mean that are far removed from the
bulk of the data, and we fail to reject values for the mean that are
close to the bulk of the data.  The *confidence interval* for the mean
is all values $x$ for which we would fail to reject the null
hypothesis that $\mu=x$.  From the above, we would conclude that 0.9
is *inside* the confidence interval [because we fail to reject the
null that $\mu=0.9$] and 1.2 is *outside* the confidence interval
[because we rejected the null that $\mu=1.2$].


All of this complicated reasoning is carried out by `t.test()`:

```{r}
t.test(kiwi)
```

which includes the confidence interval (it doesn't matter here, but
the reported p-value refers to a null of $\mu=0$).

The confidence interval is constructed so that it contains the true
value of the population mean with probability 95\%.  Note carefully
that this is not the same as saying "the true value of the mean is
contained within this confidence interval with probability 95\%".  The
confidence interval is a random variable, the result of a randomly
observed dataset.  It is constructed so that it is rare
[i.e. probability 5\%] for the true value of the mean to be outside
the confidence interval.


```{r}
f <- function(n){ as.vector(t.test(rnorm(n))$conf.int) }

set.seed(0)
plot(c(-4,4),c(1,10),axes=FALSE,xlab='',ylab='',type='n')
for(i in 1:100){
    jj <- f(10)
    if(prod(jj)<0){col <- 'black' } else {col <- 'pink'}
    segments(x0=jj[1],y0=i/10,x1=jj[2],y1=i/10,col=col,lwd=2)
}
abline(v=0)    
```

The figure above shows 100 confidence intervals generated from a
distribution where the true mean $\mu=0$.  See how the majority of the
intervals contain the true value but occasionally (with probability
5\%) the interval lies completely to one side of the true value, and
such intervals are shown in pink.  See how much of the R idiom you can
understand.

Note that although confidence interval has a univeral definition, it
is not without it problems and many workers [including your lecturer!]
question the validity of this form of reasoning.
