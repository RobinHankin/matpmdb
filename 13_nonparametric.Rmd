Up to now, all the techniques that have been used assume that the
underlying distribution has got a particular form.  The Student
t-test, for example, assumes that the observations are drawn from a
Gaussian distribution.  Calculation of p-values in general requires
knowledge of the null distribution, whether this is binomial,
hypergeometric or another parametrically determined distribution.  In
this chapter, we show some techniques that do not require any such
assumptions and operate correctly independently of the underlying
distributions.  The general word for such techniques is
*nonparametric* methods.
