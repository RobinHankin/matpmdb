hello everyone, welcome to STAT601!

My name is Robin Hankin, your lecturer.  I can be contacted on
<robin.hankin@aut.ac.nz> -- although this should be viewed as a last
resort (after asking your classmates and tutor).

My office hours are 9-10am Tuesdays, which I reserve to help any
student with any academic issue.  If you want to see me during this
time no appointment is needed; simply come to WT level 1 reception and
ask for me, I will be happy to see you.  

The course material is covered by the following youtube series:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL018X5Hlr4RkgE65Pg93TFY-32KCVpW84

Please note that although the course content will closely follow the
youtube playlist, I generally alter the order of presentation
slightly, so the weeks are somewhat out of sequence.  I will also post
various resources and learning materials on Blackboard as the semester
progresses.

The course will use the R programming language, freely available at
https://cran.r-project.org/ and you are encouraged to download and
play with the system on your own laptop.  I also use Rstudio, freely
available at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and
this includes a nice front-end and display capabilities.


STAT601 has one assignment, a portfolio, and an examination, due dates
to be advised.


Semester schedule

This is provisional, and might change slightly as the semester
progresses.  Text in brackets refers to video resources, available on
AUTonline or YouTube.


* Introduction to R and Rstudio; Bernoulli RVs and binomial distribution
* Normal distribution
* Introduction to hypothesis testing 
* Type I and type II errors
* Likelihood and support
* Point estimation; likelihood
* Poisson distribution
* Bayesian reasoning; beta distribution
* Hypergeometric distn; Fisher's exact test
* Chi-square distribution and Pearson's chi-square test
* Linear regression including logistic and logarithmic
* Quantile methods
* Nonparametric techniques: qqplot(), qqnorm(), Mann-Whitney etc (10)

Teaching resources to be distributed via AUTonline as the semester
progresses and will include printed materials and video recordings.

Video resources available for download under the 'video recordings'
tab under 'Resources' on AUTonline, or on YouTube at
